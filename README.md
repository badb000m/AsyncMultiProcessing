# AsyncMultiProcessing
# just a little thing i'm working on with my friend ion

# The final version is complete.
# This is technically an API for Multiprocessing

# What this is:
This can asynchronously compute from standard input to standard output asynchronously whilst also running a program prior to that.

# Examples:
Input -> "Enable FOR_LOOP_PROGRAM"
    -> Prints whatever in the for loop
    -> Goes back to input

Input -> "Enable WHILE_LOOP_PROGRAM"
    -> Carries on with while loop
    -> Goes back to input
